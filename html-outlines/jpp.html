<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>
    To provide a foundation of Java programming skills.
</p>
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
    Java is a general purpose programming language that can be used for a variety of tasks. For example, you could use
    Java to build Palm Pilot applications (J2ME), web-based applications (JSP and Servlets), client-side GUI
    applications (Swing and AWT), database applications (JDBC, JDO and Entity EJB) or distributed applications (EJB and
    Web Services). However, at the core, the basic concepts and syntax are the same. This hands-on Java training
    workshop covers these core concepts and syntax. We feel this Java training workshop provides a strong foundation
    upon which to start your Java training.
</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This class is designed for people who already know how to program.
    If you currently use Visual Basic, Delphi, Cobol or Fortran
    and want to learn Java then this is the place to start.
    You must have a firm grasp of programming concepts such as:
    looping, branching, functions, passing arguments to functions and returning values from functions.
    While Java, to some extent, is based on the C programming language, no prior knowledge of C is assumed.
    Also, no prior knowledge of object oriented programming is assumed.</p>
