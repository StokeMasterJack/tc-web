<div class='workshop-subtitle'>5 day hands-on workshop</div>
<p class='workshop-p'>We often see React beginners waste hundreds of hours and suffer needless complexity because they are <i>fighting the framework</i>. Once you learn to <i>Think in React</i> you'll find that complex tasks become simple. </p>

<p class='workshop-p'>This workshop will teach you everything you need to know in order to build sophisticated, real-world applications in React. This is an in-depth coverage of the React API and surrounding technologies.</p>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Workshop Format</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>In this workshop we build a project together over the course of the week. Much of this work is in the form of "do on your own" exercises. We cover the depth and breadth of the React API and related topics as they arise in the course of building this application. You'll gain an in-depth understanding of the React API, the React ecosystem and the React way of thinking. </p>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Class Size</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>Our public workshops have a maximum student count of 4. So each student is ensured an individualized training experience. We encourage you to bring in your projects and any special topics you'd like to cover. </p>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Prerequisites</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>A basic, but not advanced, knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.</p>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Price</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>$3,200</p>
<h1 class='workshop-h1'>What You'll Learn</h1>

<h2 class='workshop-h2'>React in Context</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>What is React? What problems does it solve? How does it fit into the JavaScript ecosystem? The key to understanding React is understanding the problems it was designed to solve.</p>

<li class='workshop-li'>Three problems with React</li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>JavaScript ES6 Update for React</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>React leans heavily on many new and advanced features of JavaScript. Mastering these aspects of JavaScript can make a big difference in your productivity with React. </p>

<li class='workshop-li'>Async/await</li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>JavaScript Ecosystem Update for React</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>React also leans heavily on many modern and advanced aspects of the JavaScript ecosystem. This often overwhelms newcomers to React. We'll cover everything you need to feel comfortable in your new React setup.</p>

<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Development and Build Environment</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>The React ecosystem provides a dozen of different ways to setup your development and build environment. Here we'll discuss some of the options and I'll share my recommendations for a simple and optimal setup.</p>

<li class='workshop-li'>Babel</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Create React App</li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Thinking Functional</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>80% of "Thinking in React" is "Thinking Functional". React is simple as long you do things the React way. And that means functional. Functional concepts can be a big paradigm shift. We introduce these concepts here and continue to reinforce them throughout the workshop.</p>

<ul  class='workshop-ul'><li class='workshop-li'>view = f(model)</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Higher order functions</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Map/Filter/Reduce</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Transforms versus mutations</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Function programming with complex data structures</li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Creating React Components</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>React is all about components. Everything is a component. It is one of the defining things of React. Here we cover the details of creating, using and understanding React components.</p>

<ul  class='workshop-ul'><li class='workshop-li'>Functional components</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>ES6 class components</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>The render method</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Valid return types for the render method</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Component-ish: using a local variable or function in lieu components</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Passing and consuming props</li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Using JSX</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>JSX augments the JavaScript language with native support for HTML. And this is one of the defining features of React. It's also the primary reason we need a <i>build step</i>. </p>

<ul  class='workshop-ul'><li class='workshop-li'>JSX expressions</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>JSX vs templates</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>JavaScript in HTML</li>

<li class='workshop-li'>Style and className</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Comments</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Camel Case</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Event props</li>

<li class='workshop-li'>React.createElement()</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>What does createElement return and why does it matter?</li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Conditional Rendering</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>Using JavaScript and JSX to show and hide content based on some condition. This can be frustrating if you don't learn how to do this in the "React way".</p>

<ul  class='workshop-ul'><li class='workshop-li'><i>If</i> expressions</li>
<li class='workshop-li'><i>And</i> expressions</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Function with <i>if</i> statement</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Returning <i>null</i></li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Repeating Elements</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>Most UI frameworks have some type of looping construct to create tables and lists. React does things a bit differently.</p>
<ul  class='workshop-ul'><li class='workshop-li'>UI Map functions</li>
<li class='workshop-li'>Decomposing complex map functions</li>

<li class='workshop-li'>React's event handling under the covers</li></ul>
<h2 class='workshop-h2'>Managing State</h2>
<p class='workshop-p'>Understanding <i>state</i> is critical to building React apps. Doing this wrong can lead to extra work and pain. State is how you update the UI in React. State is how you create interactive and dynamic applications in React.</p>
